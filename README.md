### [Recent Project: Data Streaming Project](https://github.com/DrLMB/streaming_data_project)

* **Summary:** a Python Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a data streaming pipeline. The script connects to The Guardian Open Platform API, retrieves the 10 most recent articles matching a specified search term, processes the data into a clean JSON format, and then publishes the records in a batch to an AWS Kinesis Data Stream.
* **Built With:** Python | Boto3 | AWS Kinesis
